# CodeEval (Defunct) Problem Statements

As of 2018-02-12, [CodeEval][ce] has ceased operations. This (unofficial)
repository mirrors* the problem statements for all 239‡ interactive challenges
that once lived on the platform.

<p>
  <sup>
  * A couple of problem statements are missing animated GIFs which I don't
  have a backup of. They were supplementary and are not required to solve the
  challenges in question.

  <sup>
  ‡ Technically, there were 240 challenges on the platform. Challenge #127
  ("Code Plagiarism") wasn't an interactive/graded challenge; thus no points
  were awarded for it by the online evaluation system.
